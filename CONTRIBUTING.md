# Avoid Conflicts {Syncing your fork}
An easy way to avoid conflicts is to add an 'upstream' for your git repo, as other PR's may be merged while you're working on your branch/fork.
```bash 
git remote add upstream https://github.com/HrutvikKhatkar/Restaurant_website_HacktoberFest.git
```
You can verify that the new remote has been added by typing
```bash
git remote -v
```
To pull any new changes from your parent repo simply run
```bash
git merge upstream/main
```
This will give you any eventual conflicts and allow you to easily solve them in your repo. It's a good idea to use it frequently in between your own commits to make sure that your repo is up to date with its parent.
